    "Welcome back to these python for SPSS users workshops. Over the last couple of weeks we have introduced you to some of the basics of working with data in python using the `pandas` module. We've introduced you to `dataframes` and some of the ways you can create them, such as creating them from scratch (`pd.DataFrame()`) or 'reading' in your data from .csv files (`pd.read_csv()`) or .sav files (`pd.read_spss()`). \n",
    "\n",
    "We then went on to talking about examining your `df` by checking things like the `head()`, `tail()`, `shape`, and `columns`. Then we took this further by looking at `slicing` our data to get specific rows and columns based on their numerical index. \n",

In this case we've made the dataset somewhat from scratch and maybe we want to be able to save it so that we can send it onto other researchers, or maybe you have done lots of work cleaning a data set and you want to save it so that yo ucan comeback and analyse it in a new jupyter notebook later. \n",

    "So above, we have two examples of saving a `pandas DataFrame`, one to a `.csv` file and one to a `.xlsx` file. Let's just take a second and walk through the actual syntax we used above. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The first thing we do is call the `variable` we want to work on, in this case using the name of our dataframe\n",
    " 2. We follow this with a fullstop `.` because saving a file is method (go back and check out week 6 for a little bit about class methods)\n",
    " 3. This is followed by `to_` and then the type of file we're exporting to, so `to_csv` for csvs or `to_excel` \n",
    " 4. Then we open brackets `()` and we pass the `path` to where we want the file to live \n",
    "    1. This can be an `r-string` \n",
    "    2. Or it can be a `pl.Path()` object\n",
    "    3. but it has to end in `\\filename.filetype`\n",
    "\n",

    "Whether or not you use an `r-string` or a `Path` is often a matter of personal prefernce, but we would encourage you to work with `Path` objects more often because they can be a lot more flexible.

For a really good breakdown of the `pathlib` module you should check out [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/) (in particular take a look at the 'Picking out the components of a path' section). These `attributes` allow us to pick apart a `path` so that we can use the bits of it we need. To get a sense of this, in the cell below create a `Path` to the `csv` version of the raw data we sent you in week 5 (it should be called 'raw_data_csv.csv' and it should be in the 'data' sub-folder)\n"

Once you have `pyreadstat` installed in your `venv` you can just use the simple `pd.read_spss(path)` to improt your dataframe. \n",

    "Firstly, we can see that, as with all Qualtrics datasets, it contains a lot of extra columns, and because this Qualtrics survey was programmed by a lunatic, obviously living fast with no regard for others, some of the columns are named things like 'Q_5... truly this was made by a monster... \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see that the we have some columns ('Q_1' to 'Q_11') that appear to be likert style scale items, and they appear to have the value labels instead of the values. This might make it difficult to calculate a total score (beacuse we have words where we would need numbers). Let's tackle these issues one at a time starting with removing the unwanted columns from our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting rid of unwanted columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on what you want to do there are a few ways get rid of columns that you don't want in your dataset, we can \n",
    " 1. drop the unwanted columns us `df.drop()` \n",
    " 2. select the wanted columns using `.iloc` or `.loc`\n",
    "and which you choose just depends on your needs, your dataset, and your preference. Lets start by looking at `df.drop()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropping columns\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage it might be pretty clear to you what `.drop()` does, partly because you've already seen the `.dropna()` method. Both of these methods allow us to just delete rows or columns from our `df`. With `dropna()` just we can quickly and easily delete alls rows that contain empty cells, `drop()` however, allows us to have a lot more control over what we're doing. In it's simplest form we use the `syntax`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_df = df.drop('Column name', axis = 1)# dropping a single column\n",
    "newer_df = df.drop(['col1', 'col2' ...], axis = 1)# dropping a list of columns\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `syntax` should be pretty familiar to you, we're using the `.drop()` method on our `df` to `return` a new `df` that doesn't have the columns we dropped in it. *Simples!*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to make the changes to your original `df` object you just use its name at the start of the `syntax`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = df.drop('Column name', axis = 1)# dropping a single column *within* the same dataframe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will overwrite your `padas DataFrame` but it won't make changes to the file you imported it from. There will be times when you want to overwrite, and there will be time when you want to make a new `df`, you'll develop a sense of which is better. As long as you're not overwiting you **Raw Data file**, the one you've imported you data from originally, it really just depends on what you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, knowing the exact name of each column matters. If you get the column name wrong you'll get an error and so what we might want to do is have a full list of all the columns (and the index number of those columns) `for`tunately we've already shown you a way to `loop` through this. Go back to the week 3 and week 4 and try to figure out how to print out the index and item `for each item in the sdf1.columns list`..."
