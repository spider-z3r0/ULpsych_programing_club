You've also learned how to give an object a short name that can be used to make it easier to work with, you've learned to `assign a variable`, and you've learned how to `call` a `function` to perform more complex operations on your objects. \n",

In python speak we want the function to `return` something to us, and to do this we add a piece of `syntax` called the `return()` statement to the end of our function.
