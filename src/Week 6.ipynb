    "To orient you around the map, it will index one axis by letters('A', 'B'....'Z') and the other axis by numbers (1, 2,.....a gazillion). The combination of these two numbers, the co-ordinates, can then orient you to a specific place on the map. You can refer to the directory to find the specific building or location your looking for (e.g., \"Starbucks Coffee - B7\"). You know then that to find Starbucks on the map, you go to B on the letter axis (in this example, the rows) and then go to 7 on the number axis (in this example, the columns). \n",
