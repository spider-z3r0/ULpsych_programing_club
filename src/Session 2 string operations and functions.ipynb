Comments are pieces of information that we write in our Python code that is not interpreted by our computer. Insteads comments are used by programmers to label their code, structure their code into sections, describe what their code is doing, and to identify areas of misunderstanding. That way when other people come to read your code (or when you come back to read your code in 6 months wondering what the hell you were trying to do) they'll be in a much better position to understand what your code is doing. To write comments in Python, we use the '#' symbol. "
