   1. Import the `pathlib module` giving it the nickname `pl`
   2. Make a list of 5 strings, make it 5 short strings, maybe the names of foods you like, or the names of your favourite movies.
   3. Use a `for loop` to print out each item in the list. 
       an example is in the `functions.py` file on brightspace.
   4. `def` a `function` that prints out each item in a list, and then `call` that function with the list you made in step 2.
       an example is in the `functions.py` file on brightspace.
   5. Look up the `methods` that allow to to make a string all uppercase, all lowercase, and to capitalize the first letter of each word.
   6. Modify your `function` so that it uses the `methods` you found in step 5 to `return` a new list with each item in the original list modified using the `string` method you passed to the function.
       - This should result in 3 new functions (there is a way to do this with only one function, but for now, make 3 separate functions that each use a different string method.)
       - An example of how to do this is in the `functions.py` file on brightspace.
   7. Use the `file explorer` in vs code to copy the path to one of the files (not a folder) you've made today.
       - Right click on the file, and select `copy path` 
   8. Use the `pathlib` module to make it a `Path` object
       - an example of how to do this is in the `paths.py` file on brightspace.
   9. look up how to print the `parent` of that `Path` object and print it out.
   10. define functions that takes in the path to a file and prints the `parent`, the `name`, or the `suffix` of that file *in all uppercase*.
         - an example of how to do this is in the `paths.py` file on brightspace.
