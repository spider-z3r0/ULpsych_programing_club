# Welcome back!! {.smaller}

 - Over the last few days we've introduced you to quarto and markdown
 - We've shown you quarto markdown and jupyter notebooks and how you can write code and text in the same document
 - And we've taken you through some programming basics like
   - Variables (saving data under a name you can use later)
   - Data types (like `strings`, `integers`, `floats`, and `booleans`)
   - Functions ( a way to `define` a set of instructions and run it multiple times)
   - Control structures (like `loops` and `if` statements)
   - Data structures (like `lists`, `dictionaries`, and `DataFrames`)
   - And more

# Recap quiz {.smaller}

 - Before we get started, let's do a quick recap quiz to see how much you remember
 - This quiz is a little longer than the previous ones, but it's still untimed
 - And getting things wrong will still remind you of the correct answer
 - It's up in Day 3 on Brightspace

# Today's plan {.smaller}

 - Today we're going to introduce you to `R`, but we're just going to be looking at how R does things you've already seen in Python
 - We'll be looking at
   - Variables
   - Data types
   - Functions
   - Control structures
   - Data structures
 - But we'll also be getting you to work in quarto markdown instead of jupyter notebooks
 - And we'll be talking you through more about best practices for setting up your projects

# Setting up your project {.smaller}

 - Over the years various researchers have come up with best practices for setting up your projects
 - And they wrapped them up in a set of guidelines called the 'Best Practices for Scientific Computing'
 - But they were too big and no one followed them...
 - So they were distilled down into a set of guidelines called the 'Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing' [@wilson2017good]

# Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing {.smaller}
 
 - I really suggest you read the paper (it's up on Brightspace)
 - There's a lot in it that may not be relevant to you now, but the principles are good to know
 - The main points are
   - Have a clear project structure (set up your folders and files in a way that makes sense)
   - Write code for humans, not computers (use comments and variable names that make sense)
   - Automate repetitive tasks (use functions and loops)
   - Use version control (there's tools like git that can help you keep track of changes to your writing and code)
   - Document everything (write down what you did and why you did it)
   - Collaborate (work with others and share your work)

# Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing {.smaller}

 - We can't cover all those points, and honestly, you'll learn them better by doing them and making mistakes
 - But things like setting up your projects in a way that makes sense, and writing code for humans are things we can help you with
 - Before jumping into R, we're going to talk about how to set up your projects in a way that makes sense
 - This means not only setting up your folders and files in a way that makes sense, but also setting up your code thoughtfully
 - Installing the things you'll need to run your `R` code
 - But first, lets practice setting up your folders

# Setting up your folders {.smaller}

 - When you start a new project, you should set up a folder for it, and then set up subfolders for different parts of your project
 - For example, you might have a folder for your data, a folder for your code, a folder for your results, and a folder for your writing
 - This makes it easier for you to work with things like `paths` and `relative paths` within and across your projects
   - It also makes it easier for you to share your work with others
   - We're going to get you to set up a folder structure for your project now
 - Using what you learned about the `explorer` pane on the left of VSCode, create a new folder called "Day 3" in the folder you've been working in all week

# Setting up your folders {.smaller}

 - Inside the "Day 3" folder, create the following subfolders
   - "data"
   - "src"
   - "output"
 - Copy the movies_df.csv file from yesterday into the "data" folder
 - And in the "src" folder, create a new file called "intro.qmd"

# Setting up your code {.smaller}

 - In python we told you that there are packages/libraries/modules that you can use to 'go beyond' the basic functionality of python
 - These are things like `pathlib`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
 - The same thing exists in `R`, but they're called `packages` or `libraries`
 - In both languages you need to install the packages before you can `import` them into your code
 - We didn't show you how to do that in python yet, but we're going to show you how to do it in `R` now


# The R terminal {.smaller}

 - On Day 0 we showeded you the terminal in VSCode
 - It's in the bottom panel of the window
 - This is a place where you can run code (commands) directly
 - On the computers you're using the terminal is running something called PowerShell by default
 - This is the windows 'shell'
 - If you were on a mac, it would be running something called `bash` which is the mac 'shell'
 - you can also run `python` and `R` code in the terminal by typing `python` or `R` and hitting enter

# The R terminal {.smaller}

 - In VSCodes, use your mouse to make the terminal bigger
 - Then type `R` and hit enter and watch how the terminal changes
 - You should see something like this

![R terminal](images/r_terminal.jpg)


# The R terminal {.smaller}
 
 - You actually already know some R code
 - Try typing `print("Hello World!")` and hitting enter in the terminal
 - You should see `Hello World!` printed out with a `[1]` in front of it
 - R and Python are very similar in a lot of ways and you'll see that as we go through the day
 - As you can see from the instructions on the screen, you can type `q()` to quit the R terminal
 - It will ask if you want to save your workspace image, just type `y` and hit enter
 - So try quitting the R terminal, then type `R` and hit enter to start it again and print `Hello World!` again

# Installing packages in R {.smaller}

 - To install packages in R, you need the R terminal open because installing packages is a command you have to run in R directly. 
 - To install a package in R, you use the `install.packages()` function
 - And you pass the name of the package you want to install as a `string` to the function
 - In order to work with quarto and R you need to install the `quarto` package (which is different from the `quarto` software)
 - So in the R terminal, type `install.packages("quarto")` and hit enter
   - This will install the quarto package on your computer, whatch the terminal to see what happens
 - You should also install the 'rmarkdown' package by typing `install.packages("rmarkdown")` and hitting enter

# Installing packages in R {.smaller}

 - Ok, you now have the packages installed that we need for this session, but there are others
    - 'tidyverse' (a collection of packages that make working with data easier)
    - 'ggplot2' (a package for making plots)
    - 'psych' (a package for doing some basic statistics)
    - 'lavaan' (a package for doing structural equation modeling)
 - Depending on your project you'll use some or all of these, we'll look at some of them throughout the day. 
 - But for now you can `quit` the R terminal by typing `q()` and hitting enter (and saving your workspace image)
