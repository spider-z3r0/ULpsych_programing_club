Quarto docuuments are essentially `plain text` with some extra `syntax` added in to tell the computer how to format the document.

 - `Plain Text` is just that, plain. It's like the text you type in a text message, or an email without any formatting.
 - `Syntax` is the set of rules that govern how the computer will interpret various symbles that you put into the `plain text` to tell *the computer how to format it*.

. . . 

There are [lots of resources to help you learn the quarto syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html), and indeed there are lots of resources to help you learn the syntax of other similar tools, but we're going to focus on the basics for now.



## The Basics
 - Quarto documents are written in `markdown` (a type of `plain text`).
 - They have a `.qmd` file extension (but other kinds of files like `.ipynb` and `.rmd` can be used too).
 - They have a `yaml` header at the top of the file (which is where you tell the computer how to format the document).
 - They use really simple symbles to indicate things like headings, lists, italics, bold, images, and links. 



## Headings. 

-   Headings are indicated by a `#` symbol at the start of a line. (There is a space after the last `#` before the actual words).

# This is a level 1 heading
It's at the top of the document and is the largest heading.

## This is a level 2 heading
It's a little smaller and is used to indicate a new section.

### This is a level 3 heading
It's a little smaller again and is used to indicate a new subsection. 



## Text Formatting

Markdown uses `*` (the star symbol, shift+8) and `_` (the underline symbol, shift+-) to indicate bold and italics.
###  Italics
*This is in italics*
_This is also in italics_

### Bold
**This is in bold**
__This is also in bold__

### Bold and Italics
***This is in bold and italics***


## Lists

Markdown supports both numbered (ordered) and unnumbered (unordered) lists. It's straightforward to create them using numbers for ordered lists and dashes or asterisks for unordered lists.

### Numbered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
    - Sub item
3. Third item

### Unnumbered Lists
- First item
- Second item
    1. Sub item
    2. Sub item 2
- Third item


## Links
Creating hyperlinks in Markdown is simple. You enclose the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses immediately after the text.
### Example Links
[Quarto](https://quarto.org)

## Images
Images are similar to links, but with an exclamation mark at the start.
### Example Image

#### Online Image
![Quarto Logo](https://quarto.org/img/logo.png)

#### Local Image
![Local Image](./images/ul-logo.png)

(Note the `/` instead of `\` in the file path. This is because the `/` is used in URLs and file paths in Unix-based systems like MacOS and Linux, while the `\` is used in Windows.
quarto will automatically convert the `/` to `\` when the document is rendered on a Windows machine but it needs to be written that way for quarto.)

## refereces section
You can also create a references section at the bottom of the document to list all the links you've used in the document. This is done by adding a `# References` heading and then listing the links in the same way you would in the main body of the document, like this:

# References
::: {#refs}
:::
