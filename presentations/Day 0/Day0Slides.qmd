Welcome to the first session of this summer school!

## In this session, we're going to:

1.  Give you an overview of the course:
    -   What we're going to be doing (learning together).
    -   Why we're doing it (to empower each other).
    -   What you can expect to get out of it (a sense of agency and efficacy).
2.  Introduce you to the tools we're going to be using (and mention some of the alternatives).
    -   Quarto (as a tool for writing documents, reports, and papers).
    -   Python (as a tool for doing data analysis and visualisation).
    -   R (as an alternative to Python for doing data analysis and visualisation).
    -   Git (as a tool for collaboration, managing your documents and code)
3.  Accompany you through the process of producing your first documents using these tools.
