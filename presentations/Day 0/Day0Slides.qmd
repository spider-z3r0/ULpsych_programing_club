## Acknowledgements
This content is building on some other really amazing work by some really amazing people, and I'll be sure to give them credit as we go along, but just to note that this material is heavily inspired by: 

- [The python crash course](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition) [@MatthesPython2022]
- [Pandas for everyone](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484259618) [@chen2017pandas]
    - There's a second edition of this, I haven't read it, but I'm sure it's great!
- [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) [@CS50Scratch2020]
    - This is free online and it's genuinely excellent, they also have intros to python and r which will go deeper than this course.
- A deep and abiding hatred of SPSS and MS Word (excel is great though, don't @ me)



## In this session, we're going to:
 -  Introduce you to the foundational tools you will use for writing in this summer school:
    -  VScode (for writing your documents and handling files/folders)
    -  Quarto (to handle formatting of your documents, headings, references)
    -  Not Write Code! (That's tomorrow, once you're more comfortable)


# But first...

Let's address the elephant(s) in the room.

# Elephant 1: Stereotypes

When you think of people who work with computer programming, you may think of people that look like this...

</div>


## But in reality...

These tools were developed by, and are used by, people from all walks of life

# Elephant 2: Pressure

## You're very smart, but...

 - You're here to **learn**. 
 - Not to be an expert. 
 - So relax and enjoy the process of learning. 


##  Inspirations {.smaller}

- '...Regard [humanity] as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.'
[@bahai_maqsud]

 - The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord.
[@abdulbaha1938advent]

 - "We are what we *repeatedly do*. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a _**habit**_.”
[@durant1933story, paraphrasing Aristotle]




# A new way of working - Let the computer do the boring stuff

## A brief history of documents

-   In the beginning, there was the cave. 
    -   And the cave was good, but it was also cold and dark, and really heavy to carry around.
<div>
    <img src="images/cave.jpg" alt="description of image" height="500px"/>
</div>

## A brief history of documents
-  Then there was the scroll, of papyrus or linen or hide. 
    -   And the scroll was good, but it was also really fragile and hard to write on (and really heavy to carry around).
<div>
    <img src="images/scroll.jpg" alt="description of image" height="500px"/>
</div>

## A brief history of documents
-  Then there was the codex, of parchment or paper. 
    -   And the codex was good, illumined with beautiful art by monks and nuns (and really heavy to carry around). 
<div>
    <img src="images\manuscript.jpeg" alt="description of image" height="500px"/>
</div>

## A brief history of documents
-  Then there was the printing press, and the typesetter. 
    -   And the books were *good* , but the machinery was hard to use requiring significant expertise (and really heavy to carry around).
<div>
    <img src="images/press.jpg" alt="description of image" height="500px"/>
</div>

## A brief history of documents
-  Then there was the computer, and the word processor. 
    -   And the documents were good, but the software was hard to use and required significant expertise (and really heavy to carry around).
<div>
    <img src="images/word.jpg" alt="description of image" height="500px"/>
</div>

## A brief history of documents
-  Then there was the internet, and the web browser. 
    -   And the documents were good, but the text was difficult to parse and required significant expertise (but the documents were really easy to carry around... maybe too easy).
<div>
    <img src="images/browser.jpg" alt="description of image" height="500px"/>
</div>

## A brief history of documents {.smaller}
With each of these advances, the process of creating and sharing documents has become somewhat more accessible, but this means that each person has to have a wider range of expertise to produce the kinds of documents that are excpected these days. Not just writing, but typesetting, graphic design etc.

## A brief history of documents
While writers and researchers were using the tools of the printer and the graphic designer, computer programmers were developing tools to help them write and share their work more effectively. 

- Tools like the IDE (integrated development environment) for writing text. 
- Tools like Markdown, quarto, and restructured text to allow you to just write and not worry about the formatting.
- Tools like the version control system for sharing and collaborating on documents (without having to email them back and forth).

## So you can focus on the *writing* and the *thinking* and let the computer do the tedious and error prone stuff. 

![](images/brent.jpg){fig-align="center" height=300}


# But why?


## Running Code with a Mouse
- Every click and action with a mouse on a computer triggers underlying code.
- Simple actions like opening a file or copying text are coded instructions being executed.


## Repetition and Efficiency
- Manually repeating an action with a mouse means running the same set of code multiple times.
- This approach can be inefficient and time-consuming for repetitive tasks.


## Writing Code for Automation
- By **writing** code instead, you can specify the instructions once, including how many times an action should be repeated.
- This allows for automation of repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors.


## Leveraging Existing Code
- You don’t always have to write code from scratch; you can use code that others have written.
- Libraries and scripts **created by others** can be applied to your specific needs, making complex operations simpler and more efficient.
- And meaning you don't have to do it (let the computer set the heading levels, format the references, and tables!)



## Empowerment through Coding
- Learning to write or modify code gives you control over your computer tasks.
- It transforms repetitive manual actions into efficient automated processes, empowering you to work smarter, not harder.
- You have a limited number of heartbeats, don't waste them on the boring stuff.





# OK Kev... Get on with it!

## So, what are we going to be doing? {.smaller}
 - Day 0: Introductions all round - getting you comfortable with writing in quarto using vscode (there's no code today, just writing).
 - Day 1: Introduction to Python - getting you comfortable with the basics of python (where you'll learn why yesterday was called 'Day 0').
 - Day 2: Python functions and libraries - getting you comfortable with using python to do data analysis and visualisation.
 - Day 3: Environment and version control - getting you comfortable with using git and github to manage your projects (code and documents).
 - Day 4: et cetera - intro to R, some example projects with Python and R, and a look at some other tools and resources.

Let's get you started by introducing you to vscode.

## Visual Studio Code

-   An IDE (integrated development environment) is a program that allows you to write, run, and debug code all in one place.
    - It 'integrates' all the tools you need to write code into one program.
-   But code is just a form of text, and so an IDE is also a text editor (with notions!).
    -   It allows you to write and edit text, and then, where appropriate, run that text as code, or run code on that text (I made this very presentation in VScode!).

## Visual Studio Code

-   Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.
-   It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-   It is highly customisable and has a large number of extensions available to add functionality.
    - For example, it has extensions that allow you to view excel style data sets *in the same program* as the document you're writing text in!
    - So no more switching between excel and word (unless... you want to... you do you).

## Visual Studio Code

Open up VS Code and let's take a look around (Don't panic!).

![](images/VSCODEoverview.png){fig-align="center" height=700}

## Visual Studio Code{.smaller}

![](images/VSCODEexplorer%20highlighted.jpg){fig-align="center" height=500}

 . . . 

-   The left-hand side of the window is the **activity bar**.
    -   It contains icons for the different views and panels in VS Code.
    -  You can click on these icons to switch between views.
    -  The main one you'll use is the 'explorer' icon, top of the activity bar, which will show you the files and folders in your project.


## Visual Studio Code{.smaller}

![](images/VSCODEexplorer_terminal_highlighted.jpg){fig-align="center" height=500}

. . . 

 -  The bottom panel is the **terminal**.
    -   This is where you can run commands and see the output of those commands.
    -   You can also run your code here.
    -   You can open the terminal by clicking on the 'terminal' icon in the bar along the top of the VScode window.



## Visual Studio Code{.smaller}

![](images/VSCODEhighlighted.jpg){fig-align="center" height=500}

. . . 

 -  The largest panel is the **editor**.
    -   This is where you write your code and text.
    -   But it's also like a browser, you can have multiple tabs open at once, and different types of files
    -   You can split the editor into multiple panes to allow for previews, to view your data while you work, or even compare different parts of the same document! 

## Visual Studio Code

OK so that's the basic layout of VScode, but there's a lot more to it than that, and we'll be exploring it as we go along.
For the next little while we're just giong to focus on the editor, with a little bit about the explorer (cause that's where you'll be spending most of your time).
Open up VS Code and lets jump in. 

::: {.notes}
Show people how to open VScode, and walk them through the process of opening for the first time. 
Don't forget the 'welcome' screen, and some of the choices they'll make. Give some time here. 
:::


## Visual Studio Code
To open VScode you can either:

 -   Click on the icon on your desktop or in your start menu.
 -   Press the windows key and type 'vscode' or 'code' and press enter.
 -   Right-click on a folder (or file) and select 'open with code' from the menu (if it's installed on your device).

::: {.notes}
Mention that we've installed vscode for them, and the other stuff we've installed (quarto, python, git, and r).
:::

## Visual Studio Code
When you open VScode for the first time, you'll see a welcome screen, this gives you some options for how you want VScode to look and feel, and some options for what you want to do with it.

. . .
 
![VScode welcome screen](images/VSCODEwelcome.jpg){fig-align="center" height=500}

## Visual Studio Code

-   You can choose a theme (light or dark).
-   You can choose a colour scheme.
-   You can choose a font.

## Visual Studio Code

Do these choices matter? Not really so don't stress. They are aesthetic choices, and you can change them at any time, but thier there because you'll be spending a lot of time in VScode and you should be there. 

Take some time and look around the screen, I'll be walking around to make sure that you see everything. 

## Visual Studio Code{.smaller}
OK, when you've selected a theme, click on the 'file' button in the top left of the window, and then click on 'open folder'.

On the computer you're using there is a folder called 'Programming summer school' at the address: 

### "C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Programming\ summer\ school"
 
![](images/VSCODEopenfolder.jpg){fig-align="left" height=500}
![VScode welcome screen](images/VSCODEwelcome_after_theme.jpg){fig-align="right" height=500}

::: {.notes}
Point out the two options but focus on the 'file' button and the 'open folder' option because it'll be more common. 
:::

## Visual Studio Code{.smaller}
![](images/VSCODEfolder%20select.jpg){fig-align="center" height=500}
Select that folder.



## Visual Studio Code{.smaller}

If it's the first time you've selected or opened this folder (or a subfolder of it), you'll see a message asking if you 'Trust the authors of the folder'.

![](images/VSCODEauthor_trust.jpg){fig-align="center" height=500}

. . . 

Click 'Yes, I trust the authors' (because you do, right?).

## Visual Studio Code{.smaller}

You should now see the 'explorer' view in the activity bar on the left of the window, and a list of files and folders in the 'Programming summer school' folder.
Right now there's only one file, called `example.qmd`.

Lets open that file and introduce you to your new best friend, the quarto markdown document!


# Quarto

## What is quarto? {.smaller}
 - Quarto is a piece of software that works "under the hood" in your IDE (VScode in our case) to allow you to:
    - Write documents in a simple, plain text format.
    - Format those documents using a simple syntax.
    - Include code (for data analysis for example) and the output of that code in your documents.
    - Include references and citations in your documents.
    - Include tables and images in your documents.
    - And much more!



:::{.notes}
You can mention pandoc, rmarkdown etc here, but this isn't a history lesson. 
:::



## Why am Quarto? 
 - Quarto was developed (essentially) by the scientific community to allow reserachers to take advantage of modern work flow:
    - To allow remove the tedium of working formatting documents by hand.
    - To not have to care about what the document will look like while you're writing.
    - To allow you to focus on the writing and the thinking, and let the computer do the boring stuff.

. . . 

In the links for this presentation you'll find wider info about quarto, but for now, let's just get you started.



## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
Quarto doc uments are essentially `plain text` with some extra `syntax` added in to tell the computer how to format the document.

 - `Plain Text` is just that, plain. It's like the text you type in a text message, or an email without any formatting.
 - `Syntax` is the set of rules that govern how the computer will interpret various symbols that you put into the `plain text` to tell *the computer how to format it*.

. . . 
  
There are [lots of resources to help you learn the quarto syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html), and indeed there are lots of resources to help you learn the syntax of other similar tools, but we're going to focus on the basics for now.


## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### The Basics  
 - Quarto documents are written in `markdown` (a type of `plain text`).
 - They have a `.qmd` file extension (but other kinds of files like `.ipynb` and `.rmd` can be used too).
 - They have a `yaml` header at the top of the file (which is where you tell the computer how to format the document).
 - They use really simple symbols to indicate things like headings, lists, italics, bold, images, and links. 


## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### markdown basics : Headings. 

-   Headings are indicated by a `#` symbol at the start of a line.


```{markdown} 

# This is a level 1 heading
It's at the top of the document and is the largest heading.

## This is a level 2 heading
It's a little smaller and is used to indicate a new section.
 
### This is a level 3 heading
It's a little smaller again and is used to indicate a new subsection.
~~~
```



# This is a level 1 heading
It's at the top of the document and is the largest heading.

## This is a level 2 heading
It's a little smaller and is used to indicate a new section.

### This is a level 3 heading
It's a little smaller again and is used to indicate a new subsection. 


## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### markdown basics : Headings. 


```{markdown} 
# This is a level 1 heading
It's at the top of the document and is the largest heading.

## This is a level 2 heading
It's a little smaller and is used to indicate a new section.
 
### This is a level 3 heading
It's a little smaller again and is used to indicate a new subsection.
```


::: {.notes}
Say that we're ignoring lines 1-4, call out line 6, and then walk through the rest of the example.
:::


## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### markdown basics : Bold and Italics.
Markdown uses `*` (the star symbol, shift+8) and `_` (the underline symbol, shift+-) to indicate bold and italics.

```{markdown}

### Italics
*This is in italics*
_This is also in italics_

### Bold
**This is in bold**
__This is also in bold__

### Bold and Italics
***This is in bold and italics***


```


## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### markdown basics : Bold and Italics.

###  Italics
*This is in italics*
_This is also in italics_

### Bold
**This is in bold**
__This is also in bold__

### Bold and Italics
***This is in bold and italics***

## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### markdown basics : Lists

Markdown supports both numbered (ordered) and unnumbered (unordered) lists. It's straightforward to create them using numbers for ordered lists and dashes or asterisks for unordered lists.

```{markdown}
### Numbered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
    - Sub item
3. Third item

### Unnumbered Lists
- First item
- Second item
    1. Sub item
    2. Sub item 2
- Third item
```

::: {.notes}
Don't forget to highlight that you can mix and match the two types of lists
:::

## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### markdown basics : Lists


### Numbered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
    - Sub item
3. Third item

### Unnumbered Lists
- First item
- Second item
    1. Sub item
    2. Sub item 2
*  Third item

::: {.notes}
For the numbered lists, each item starts with a number followed by a dot. Markdown automatically numbers the items correctly, even if you use `1.` for all items. For unnumbered lists, you can use either `-` or `*` to start each item. The choice between dashes and asterisks is purely stylistic.
:::

## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### markdown basics : Links

Creating hyperlinks in Markdown is simple. You enclose the link text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses immediately after the text.

```{markdown}

[Quarto](https://quarto.org)
```

## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### markdown basics : Links

### Example Links
[Quarto](https://quarto.org)

::: {.notes}
When creating links, ensure there is no space between the closing square bracket and the opening parenthesis. This syntax will render the text in the square brackets as a clickable hyperlink pointing to the URL in the parentheses.
:::


## Quarto Documents{.smaller}
### markdown basics : Recap

```{markdown}

## This is a level 2 heading

*This text is in italics*
**This text is in bold**
***This text is in bold and italics***

### Numbered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
    - Sub item

### Unnumbered Lists
- First item
- Second item
    1. Sub item
    2. Sub item 2

```

## Quarto Practice{.smaller}

OK that's the basics of markdown, and the basics of quarto, but it's a lot. Let's take a few minutes to practice.

Rather than editing the `example.qmd` file, let's create a new file to practice in.

 - If you hover over the 'explorer' area on the left of the window, you'll see a little icon that looks like a piece of paper with a plus sign on it. Click on that to create a new file.
 - Type `intentions.qmd` into the box that pops up and press enter. (Yay!! You now know how to create a new file in VScode!)
 - In this new document using the markdown syntax we've just learned, write a few paragraphs about your intentions for the summer school.
    1. What do you hope to learn?
    2. Is there a particular project you might use this knowledge for?
    3. What are you most excited about?
    4. What are you most nervous about?
    5. Look around for a website that you think might be useful to you, and include a link to it in your document.

. . . 

Unless you share it no one else will be able to see that file, so don't worry about what you write. 

When you want to save what you've written, just press `ctrl+s` (or `cmd+s` on a mac). 


# Rendering and Previewing
Now that you've written your document, (and I've spent ages convincing you that all you have to do is write) you probably want to see what it looks like, right? 

## Rendering and Previewing{.smaller}
 - The computer uses the `syntax` to format the `plain text` into a `pretty document`.
 - This process is called `rendering` (you've heard me say that already).
 - You can `render` your document at any time to see what it looks like.
 - You can also `preview` your document in a separate window to see what it looks like. 

## Rendering and Previewing{.smaller}
This is the first time we'll use the `terminal` in VScode, and it's really simple. 
 - Click on the `terminal` icon in the bar along the top of the VScode window.
 - Click 'new terminal' from the menu that pops up.

. . . 
 
You should see a new panel open at the bottom of the window. This is the terminal.

![](images/VSCODEterminal_isolated.png){fig-align="center"}

## Rendering and Previewing{.smaller}
And now we just need to use the `terminal` to tell Quarto to `render` our document. 

Now these commands can be really *really* complex, so you're really going to have to pay attention here. 

## Rendering and Previewing{.smaller}
Seriously, it's really complex.

## Rendering and Previewing{.smaller}
Acctually... maybe you're not ready for this yet.


## Rendering and Previewing{.smaller}

Oh OK. 

It's `quarto render` followed by the (full)name of the file you want to render (in this case `intentions.qmd`).

```{bash}
> quarto render intentions.qmd
```


Phew! I hope everyone is OK after that.

## Rendering and Previewing{.smaller}

You can also `preview` your document in a separate window to see what it looks like. 

```{bash}
> quarto preview intentions.qmd
```

Every time you save the document, the preview will update to show you what the document looks like.

Do that now, and take a look at your document.

Try to make a change to your document, save it (ctrl+s), and then see how the preview updates to show you the change.
